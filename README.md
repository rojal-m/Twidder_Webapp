#   TDDD97 Web Programming - Twidder (Completed)

##  Getting started

1.  [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.  Put python to path environment

3.  [Install virtualenv using pipx](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html#via-pipx) and make sure to [Install pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/) first

4.  Make a directory to setup the virtual environment preferabily inside a users directory
    ```
    mkdir py_virEnv
    ```
    ```
    cd py_virEnv
    ```
    ```
    virtualenv -p python3 tddd97
    ```

5.  Activate the environment
	```
    cd tddd97
    ```
    ```
    Scripts\activate
    ```

    **Note [in Windows]**: While trying to activate the environment I got an error saying that "running scripts is disabled on this system".
    
    So I did:
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```
    Then I could activated the environment and after that I did:

	```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope Process
    ```

    So that the system wont stay unsafe.

6.  Install Flask
	```
    pip install Flask
    ```

7.  Install Flask Socket
    ```
    pip install flask-sock
    ```

8.  Install Eventlet
	```
    pip install eventlet
    ```

##  Running the server
Run the server either in Development mode:	
```
flask --app server run --debug
```
Or in Production mode:
```
python server.py
```
##  Testing the server API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
