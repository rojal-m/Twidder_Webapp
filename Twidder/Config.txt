1. Install Python
2. Put python to path environment
3. Install virtualenv using pip {
	> python -m pip install --user virtualenv
   }
4. Put virtualenv's path to path environment
4. Make a suitable directory to setup the virtual environment {
	> mkdir py_virEnv
	> cd py_virEnv
	> virtualenv -p python3 tddd97
   }
5. Activate the environment {
	> tddd97\Scripts\activate
   }

Note [in Windows]: While trying to activate the environment I got an error saying that "running scripts is disabled on this system".
So I did:
	> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
Then I could activated the environment and after that I did:
	> Set-ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope Process
So that the system wont stay unsafe.

6. Install Flask {
	> pip install Flask
   }
7. install Gevent {
	> pip install gevent
{


pip install gunicorn




Running the server:
	> flask --app server run --debug
Or:
	> python server.py
